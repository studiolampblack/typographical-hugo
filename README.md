# Tale

This is a port of the [Tale theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) to Hugo. Tale is a minimal Jekyll theme curated for storytellers. Checkout the demo [here](https://chesterhow.github.io/tale/). I did not design this theme; I only ported it from Jekyll to Hugo.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this theme is to add it as a submodule. Inside the folder of your Hugo site, run the following command.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/EmielH/tale-hugo.git themes/tale
```

For more information, read the official [setup guide]( https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.
